/*****************************************************************************
 * cspI2C_EFM32_M3.h
 *
 *  Created on: Jun 29th, 2018
 *  Author: kgmills
 *
 *  The code was originally based off of and is heavily modified from the Silicon Labs Application Note:
 *  https://www.silabs.com/support/resources.ct-application-notes.ct-example-code.p-microcontrollers_32-bit-mcus
 *
 *  See "AN0011: I2C Master and Slave Operation"
 *  Also see "AN0013: Direct Memory Access" as this I2C Physical Layer Driver is dependent on the EFM32's
 *  DMA controller for Tx/Rx operation - cspDMA_EFM32_M3 is a dependency
 *
 *  This is an I2C Driver for the EFM32 Giant Gecko using the ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor.
 *  It requires the use of FreeRTOS (developed with V7.4.2) to work.
 *
 *  As it is meant to be one interface for the physical layer of a CubeSat Network Stack, only
 *  two modes of operation were implemented:
 *	-MASTER TRANSMITTER
 *	-SLAVE RECEIVER
 *
 *	The driver makes heavy use of the DMA controller within the EFM32 as well as a shared memory
 *	FreeRTOS protocol I developed when it is not integrated with a network stack e.g. CSP
 *	These non-Silabs dependency files are
 *	- cspDMA_EFM32_M3.c/h
 *	- SharedMemory.c/h
 *
 *	MIND THE TODO TAGS I HAVE PLACED THROUGHOUT THE CODE FOR COMMENTS
 *	ON SWITCHING BETWEEN HAVING THE DRIVER AS A STANDALONE AND INTEGRATING IT WITH
 *	CSP WHICH PROVIDES ACCESS TO BUFFERS.
 *
 *	Pull-up Resistors used:
 *	330 Ohms and 2.7 kOhms
 *
 *	MTU Constraints:
 *	Due to the nature of the DMA controller on the EFM32 with the Cortex-M3, the maximum transmission
 *	length for a frame being sent by this driver is 1024 bytes.
 *
 *	Performance: With the DMA integrated, this driver was tested and checked with a clock controlled
 *	variable of a 400kHz clock. Measuring the time it takes a transmission to complete on an oscilloscope,
 *	the time taken for a 20 byte (1 byte address + 19 byte frame) message is roughly 500 Microseconds.
 *  This entails a data rate of roughly 320kbit/s or 80% of maximum throughput.
 *
 *  A different driver can be developed from this one for the
 *	Giant Gecko with the Cortex-M4, with the double-buffered
 *	I2C Tx/Rx and LDMA. By my estimation, it's MTU will be roughly 4096 bytes.
 *
 *	To Accomplish this upgrade, you would need to do the following:
 *
 *	- When the DMA IRQ goes off for Rx, you need to modify the equation for
 *	calculating the address of the CTRL register
 *
 *	- Likewise, when taking the # of transmissions left from the CTRL register,
 *	the equation used will need to be modified and account for the fact that the
 *	n_minus_1 (or equivalent) field is 11 bits long on the M4, where it is only
 *	10 bits long on the M3
 *
 *	- To exceed an MTU of 2048 bytes, the DMA needs to be configured to
 *	send 2 bytes (16 bits) at a time rather than 1 byte (8 bits) as it does now.
 *
 *	- Therefore, you will need to figure out a scheme for sending only the right
 *	data and not +/- 1 byte of data. To do this, I propose:
 *	-- When the size of the packet is odd, before invoking the DMA, place
 *	the I2C Slave address and the first byte of packet data into the 16-bit Tx buffer.
 *	Then invoke the DMA, with an initial start address being the 2nd byte of data.
 *	-- When the size of the packet is even, load the address into the 16-bit buffer,
 *	leave 1/2 of the Tx buffer empty, then invoke the DMA on the base address of data.
 *
 *	CURRENT ISSUES:
 *	- The module doesn't like the transmit at its maximum MTU for long.
 *	If I give it a 1024byte frame it will transmit once or twice and then get locked up.
 *
 *	- Likewise, when the module locks itself up, even reports the error, it does not recover
 *	I cannot get it to properly reset and restart itself for additional transfers I have to reset
 *	the development board or re-flash it.
 *
 *	- As the EFM32GG Dev board with the M3 can only route I2C SCL/SDA to one location
 *	each, this driver only works when all "handle" input args are set to '1' and only
 *	through the I2C1 module.
