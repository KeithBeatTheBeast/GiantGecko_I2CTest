 * @brief
 *   Initializes DMA controller. Copied from SiLabs code from em_dma.c and modified so that it can work
 *   For a variable number of active DMA channels instead of assuming all are active.
 *
 * @details
 *   This function will reset and prepare the DMA controller for use. Although
 *   it may be used several times, it is normally only used during system
 *   init. If reused during normal operation, notice that any ongoing DMA
 *   transfers will be aborted. When completed, the DMA controller is in
 *   an enabled state.
 *
 * @note
 *   Must be invoked before using the DMA controller.
 *
 * @param[in] init
 *   Pointer to a structure containing DMA init information.

	 * THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CODE BLOCK - BREAK IT AND THE DMA. WILL. NOT. WORK.
	 * The base address for the DMA controller's descriptors MUST be a multiple of the total size
	 * of the memory allocated.
	 * There are some ways to achieve this end, one way is to use a specialized malloc, memalign
	 * https://linux.die.net/man/3/memalign
	 * However, it is obsolete. Also our faculty advisor said this is a no-no.
	 *
	 * Another way is to allocate more than you need, but enough so that you can be guaranteed to find an appropriate address
	 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/227897/how-to-allocate-aligned-memory-only-using-the-standard-library
	 * I will let the most popular answer explain how it works.
	 *
	 * I tried using statically allocated blocks at compile time, it did NOT work!
