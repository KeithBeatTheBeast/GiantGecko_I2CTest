/***************************************************************************//**
 * @brief
 *   Initializes DMA controller. Copied from SiLabs code from em_dma.c and modified so that it can work
 *   For a variable number of active DMA channels instead of assuming all are active.
 *
 * @details
 *   This function will reset and prepare the DMA controller for use. Although
 *   it may be used several times, it is normally only used during system
 *   init. If reused during normal operation, notice that any ongoing DMA
 *   transfers will be aborted. When completed, the DMA controller is in
 *   an enabled state.
 *
 * @note
 *   Must be invoked before using the DMA controller.
 *
 * @param[in] init
 *   Pointer to a structure containing DMA init information.
